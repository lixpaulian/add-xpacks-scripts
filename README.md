# Scripts to add xpacks to a project
This is a collection of scripts that retrieve the required files out of an xpack and places them in a project. It is a temporary solution until GUI based wizards will be available.

Basically a script should exist for each xpack. Currently only a handful of scripts are available for projects based on STM32F4xx and STM32F7xx controllers but more are on their way.

For more details on the xpacks check the following links:
